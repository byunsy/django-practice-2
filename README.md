## Descriptions

This is a second small Django exercise for myself to practice Django, Bootstrap, and jQuery. The code will generate a minimalistic ecommerce shopping website with basic features like registering, sign-in, sign-out, viewing/uploading products, 'purchasing' an item, and keeping track of current stock of each product. The Bootstrap template used here is called [Minty](https://bootswatch.com/minty/) and more temnplates can be found in [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/). I also used [Summernote](https://summernote.org/) which a user can utilize when writing product description.
